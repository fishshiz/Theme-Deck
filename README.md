# Theme Deck

Theme Deck is a easy and lightweight way to shuffle through different vscode themes througout the day. This extension helps keep your editor fresh and new looking everytime you come back to it.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply install the extension, refresh your editor and run the `Shuffle Themes` command in the command box. This command will pick a random theme from your installed themes and set it to all of your editors. It will then cycle through your other themes on a adjustable interval. If you ever want to pick another random theme, you can just run the command again.

> Tip: You can adjust the length of intervals in minutes by adjusting the `themeDeck.intervalTime` attribute in settings.

## Extension Settings

Theme Deck currently contributes just the following configuration setting:

* `themeDeck.intervalTime`: specifies the interval time (in minutes) between theme switches.

## Release Notes

This is my first ever authored extension (WOOOOO!!!). I'm still figuring a lot of this out, but am planning on adding new customizable features in the future, so stay tuned!

### 1.0.0

Initial release of Theme Deck ðŸš€. Automated theme shuffling.

### 1.1.0

Fixes a few bugs, and adds two new commands: `Shuffle Themes (Dark)` and `Shuffle Themes (Light)`.

**Enjoy!**
