# Theme Deck

Theme Deck is a easy and lightweight way to shuffle through different vscode themes througout the day. This extension helps keep your editor fresh and new looking everytime you come back to it.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply install the extension, refresh your editor and run the `Shuffle Themes` command in the command box. This command will pick a random theme from your installed themes and set it to all of your editors. It will then cycle through your other themes on a adjustable interval. If you ever want to pick another random theme, you can just run the command again.

> Tip: You can adjust the length of intervals in minutes by adjusting the `themeDeck.intervalTime` attribute in settings.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something

## Known Issues

Calling out known issues can help limit users opening duplicate issues against your extension.

## Release Notes

This is my first ever authored extension (WOOOOO!!!). I'm still figuring a lot of this out, but am planning on adding new customizable features in the future, so stay tuned!

### 1.0.0
